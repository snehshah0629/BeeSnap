# BeeSnap-ML

This is the repository for the Machine Learning sub-team of the BeeSnap V.I.P. (Vertically Integrated Project) at Georgia Institute of Technology. This project consists of two main components. 

## Bee Flower Classification Model
The first component is a CNN model written using Keras and Tensorflow that classifies species of bees and flowers in Georgia. This model is able to successfully identify the species of a bee or flower given an image with over 90% accuracy, and will be integrated into a mobile application currently being developed by another sub-team in BeeSnap. Being able to identify specific bee and flower species can be used to further understand certain bee-flower interactions and can help researchers and bee hive owners formulate better strategies to grow their hives.

## Bee Tracking Module
The second component is an object tracking module written using OpenCV that tracks bee movements in a webcam or video. The purpose of this module is to collect data on bee movement patterns in beehives over time in order to predict and forecast swarming trends and patterns. Swarms are essentially when a large proportion of a bee hive population migrates to form a new hive, roughly reducing the original hive size by roughly 50%. The idea behind swarm forecasting is to help bee hive owners better understand when swarms may be most likely to occur so they can take preventative measures well in advance of a swarm to minimize the impact that swarms may have on their hive populations.
